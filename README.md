# Cancer Prediction Model

## Introduction

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting whether a given instance of cancer is malignant or benign. The model is trained on a dataset containing relevant features associated with cancer cases and is capable of making predictions based on these features.

## Features

- **Malignancy Prediction**: The model can classify cancer instances as either malignant or benign based on input features.

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been performed on the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of the data.

- **Performance Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision.
